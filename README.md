# VBA-challenge
This is my Module 2:VBA it contains the VBA script in a notepad file.
I was not able to get the screenshots of the output of my VBA script from the original multiple_year_stock_data, seeing as my computer seems to run for over 45 minutes and no output was still obtained(tutor suggested it could be due to my computer being slow), therefore, I have provided the screen shots of the output my VBA script has given from the alphabetical_testing data instead. 
Please disregard the .jpg files and look at the .png files instead. Better quality.

Note; when I was stuck in certian portions of my script I did receive help from Learning assistants to manipulate and rearrange my VBA script.
